<h1>RDP Sesson Checker</h1>

### [Project Walkthrough](https://kmac907.tech/index.php/2023/06/28/learning-powershell-rdp-session-checker/)

<h2>Description</h2>

Just a quick script I built that searches and pulls all the logged rdp sessions. It then uses the $desktopPath variable to retrieve the users desktop direcroty path. The output is printed to a .txt file subsequently named "output.txt" and saved to the users desktop. A detailed walkthrough can be found on my portfolio(linked above). Where I document the projects that I do.
